## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

### This is the official Mechmania github page! 

MechMania is a KW region-based **robotics competition**, run by high school students for high school students. Last year, we got over **120** students from 12 schools to join us for weeks of engineering and building, culminating in a day of **8 hours of workshops, lessons, networking, and exciting robotics challenges**.


**[Here](https://mechmania.ca/)**, you can find our website, where there is more information about the competition, and where you can join our **mailing list**.
